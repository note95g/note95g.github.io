<h3>Researchers Oldest Human Footprints in North America Are in New Mexico</h3>
<br>
<p> 
Footprints discovered in New Mexico suggest that early humans were in North America around 23,000 years ago, researchers reported recently. <br>
The fossilized footprints were found in a dry lake in White Sands National Park in 2009.<br>
Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey recently studied seeds stuck in the footprints to estimate their age.<br>
Evidence suggested they were from 21,130 to 22,800 years ago.<br>
The findings may help scientists answer a basic question:<br>
When did people first arrive in the Americas, after spreading out from Africa and Asia?<br>
Most scientists believe the migration path included land, now underwater, that linked Asia with what is now the state of Alaska.<br>
Past research has suggested that humans arrived in the Americas from 13,000 to 26,000 years ago.<br>
Such findings were based on different kinds of evidence - including stone tools, fossil bones and genetic studies.<br>
The recent study gives a more solid baseline for when humans were in North America.<br>
Fossil footprints are more direct, clearer evidence than "cultural artifacts, modified bones, or other more conventional fossils," the researchers wrote in the publication Science.<br>
"What we present here," they said, "is evidence of a firm time and location."<br>
Location means a place or position.<br>
Based on the size of the footprints, researchers believe that some were made by children who lived during the last ice age.<br>
David Bustos, the park's resource program manager, saw the first footprints in ancient wetlands in 2009.<br>
He and others found more in the park over the years.<br>
"We knew they were old, but we had no way to date the prints before we discovered some with (seeds) on top," he said.<br>
Bustos said the researchers had to work quickly and carefully to secure pieces of the footprints for study.<br>
The footprints were made of extremely fine earth material and could easily be damaged.<br>
"The only way we can save them is to record them - to take a lot of photos and make 3D models," he said.<br>
Earlier digs in White Sands National Park have uncovered fossilized tracks left by a saber-toothed cat, dire wolf, Columbian mammoth and other ice age animals.<br>
